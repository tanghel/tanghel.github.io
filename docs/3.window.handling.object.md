# Window Handling Object

Never call Override-Methods, because:

- these methods are in general called automatically from the framework, as a result of an action
- they are usually part of a sequence of actions (OnSave() is called after OnPreSave() – if the latter returned>0 – and if OnSave() returns>0, OnPostSave() is called)
- these methods are the equivalent of "event handlers", which should never be called directly; if the code sequence contained in the override method is needed, a common method should be written and called every time it is needed
- whenever an event has to be called, it means that the functionality behind the event should be extracted into a method; in this case, the method can be called from the event itself, as well as anywhere else, explicitly. 

**Example**: 

- call WHO-method in override Method:

```
public override void OnNew(UIElement sourceControl)
{
    if (sourceControl == dgMaterial)
    {
        NewMaterial();
    }
}
```

- call BusinessObject-method from WHO-method:
```
public virtual void NewMaterial()
{
    var material = BusObj.NewMatRow();
    if (material == null) return;
}

```
